## The Tribute Fence
 
Beginning June 30, 2013, the day that nineteen Granite Mountain Hotshots died fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire, the fence outside Fire Station 7 became a place of tribute and mourning. In September, an amazing group of volunteers recognized the need to preserve the tangible outpouring of community grief and respect along the fence at Prescott Fire Station 7. Led by Jan Monroe and Dottie Morris, the volunteers began to carefully remove t-shirts, flags, toys and artwork from the fence, photographing them and documenting details. Six months and 10,000 photographs later, Jan and Dottie identified the Arizona Memory Project as the perfect place to make these digital records available to the public, creating a kind of online museum about the Tribute Fence.

## About the Digital Collection
